<h3 class="ABOUT">ABOUT</h3>

<p class="desc"> I started doing photography by taking beginning and advanced photography 
  classes at Castro Valley High School. These were my favorite classes and with the resources
  available I was able to get a lot of experience to build my portfolio during my advanced year.
  Now I've graduated and am attempting to turn photography into a career.

<p class="desc"> I use a Sony a7ii DSLR. With most of my photography I like to use
  various techniques and editing to create a unique style of photos.
